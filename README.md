# E-Commerce Business Analysis

## Project Overview
SQL-based analysis of e-commerce data to uncover customer behavior patterns, evaluate sales performance, and identify retention opportunities. This project demonstrates data analysis skills through structured SQL queries and business-focused insights.

## Key Findings
- **Customer Conversion Challenge**: 44% of signups (4,423 users) never made a purchase, indicating significant drop-off in the conversion funnel
- **Retention Performance**: 35% repeat purchase rate among buyers, within acceptable benchmarks but with room for improvement
- **Revenue Concentration**: Customers highly dispersed geographically (largest city(North Michael): 13 of 10,000 users); Electronics category is clear revenue leader
- **High-Value Segment**: 292 orders (15% of revenue) from top-spending customers demonstrate importance of VIP retention

## Skills Demonstrated

- **SQL Proficiency**: Complex queries using JOINs, CTEs, window functions, subqueries
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Identified and handled missing data, duplicates, and outliers with business-appropriate rationale
- **Business Metrics**: Customer segmentation, conversion funnels, cohort analysis, retention rates
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboard in Power BI showing key metrics and trends
- **Analytical Thinking**: Connected data patterns to actionable business insights

## Tools 
- SQL Server Management Studio
- Power BI Desktop


## Dataset
Practice e-commerce dataset including:
- 10,000 customers
- 20,000 orders across 22 months
